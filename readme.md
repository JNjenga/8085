{insert name here} is a graphical intel 8085 emulator that I've been working on in my free time.
While it's development is solely for (my)recreation, it can be used as a teaching tool for those who don't have
access to a physical 8085 training kit and for Microprocessor classes.

The goal is to try as much as possible to emulate all the aspects of the microprocessor.
From the instruction set, to cycles to io devices.
